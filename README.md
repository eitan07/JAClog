## What is JACLog?
* JACLog stands for Just A Casual Logger, nothing too special.
* JACLog made for making logging easy as possible.
* JACLog is very lightweight (12kb) and requires just one copy of the DLL for the entire system (You heard that right! just one!)
* JACLog is updating and evolving constantly, issues are more than welcomed!
